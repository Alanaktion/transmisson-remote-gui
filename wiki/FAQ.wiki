*Q:* Is it possible to run transgui directly from a USB stick?

*A:* Yes. Just create a folder on your USB stick and copy there the *transgui* executable file (and, optionally, the *lang* folder). Then create empty *transgui.ini* file in that folder. Now you can tun the transgui executable directly from the USB stick. All settings will be stored at the stick as well.


*Q:* Is it possible to run several instances of the program?

*A:* Yes. By default, transgui stores all it's settings in the user's profile. To run an extra instance of the program, you need to explicitly specify some other folder to store the program's settings. To do that, pass the *`--home=<home_dir>`* parameter. Where `<home_dir>` is some folder where the program's settings of the new instance will be stored.
