#summary How to get a call stack to track a error.

Often it is not possible to find and fix a error, if a user just reports: "I have the error X, when I try to do Y".

It is needed to provide more details, like a call stack information with line numbers.


To do that:
 * Build the program using Lazarus IDE as described [Building here].
 * Run the program from the IDE by pressing the {{{F9}}} key or choosing {{{Run > Run}}} from the menu.
 * When the error will occur press the {{{Break}}} button in the error window.
 * Open the Call stack window using the {{{View > Debug windows > Call Stack}}} menu item.
 * Choose the {{{Max 50}}} on the toolbar of the Call Stack window.
 * Press the {{{Copy All}}} button to copy the call stack information to the clipboard.
 * Paste this call stack information to your bug report.
